need to iterate through the guess and the choice word
capture exact matches and close matches

guess:  least
choice: great

1 match (t)
2 close (e, a)

for i in 1:length(word)
    is l the same as g?
        no, so see if it occurs elsewhere
            is l the same as g?
            is l the same as r?
            ...
            is l the same as t?
            so no scores are added
    is e the same as r?
        no, so see if it occurs elsewhere
            is e the same as g?
            ...
            is e the same as e?
                yes, so add to score and go to next guess letter
                [not sure how we're handling duplicates]
    ...
    is t the same as t?
        yes, add to score and go to the next letter in guess
