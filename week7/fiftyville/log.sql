Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.

Goal is to identify:
- Who the thief is,
- What city the thief escaped to, and
- Who the thiefâ€™s accomplice is who helped them escape

All you know is that the theft took place on July 28, 2021 and that it took place on Humphrey Street.
