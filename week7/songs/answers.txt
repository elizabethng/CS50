Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average
energy, valence, and danceability of a personâ€™s top 100 songs from the past year.

Query
SELECT
  AVG(energy),
  AVG(valence),
  AVG(danceability)
FROM
  songs;

+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

This person's music is highly danceable and energetic.
You could use a median or perhaps look at all their songs
for the year to get a better aura index.
