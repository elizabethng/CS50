Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

It appears that there is a less than linear increase in run time with N, it is faster than
expected based on s/run from the initial N = 10 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

1000 simulations seems to strike a good balance between some certainty about the order
of the placements and also stability in the point estimates of the probabilies.
